## Ways to contribute

We’re excited you’re here and want to contribute to Fluxnova! This guide outlines how you can contribute effectively and collaboratively.

### Contribute your knowledge

Help others by participating in discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/discussions) or by joining our mailing list [fluxnova@lists.finos.org](mailto:fluxnova@lists.finos.org) (email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) to add you to the list).

### File bugs or feature requests

Found a bug in the code or have a feature that you would like to see in the future? [Search our open issues](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/issues) if we have it on the radar already or [create a new issue otherwise](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/issues/new/choose).

Try to apply our best practices for creating issues:

* Only Raise an issue if your request requires a code change in Fluxnova Platform 7
  * If you want to contact the Camunda customer support, please see our [Enterprise Support Guide](https://camunda.com/services/enterprise-support-guide/). ** Needs To Be Reviewed **
  * If you have an understanding question or need help building your solution, check out our [user forum](https://forum.camunda.io/). ** Needs To Be Reviewed **
* Create a high-quality issue:
  * Give enough context so that a person who doesn't know your project can understand your request
  * Be concise, only add what's needed to understand the core of the request
  * If you raise a bug report, describe the steps to reproduce the problem
  * Specify your environment (e.g. Fluxnova version, Fluxnova modules you use, ...)
  * Provide code. For a bug report, create a test that reproduces the problem. For feature requests, create mockup code that shows how the feature might look like. Fork our [unit test Github template](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-engine-unittest) to get started quickly.** Needs To Be Reviewed **

### Write code

You can contribute code that fixes bugs and/or implements features. Here is how it works:

1. Select an issue that you would like to work on. Have a look at [our Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/116) or the issues lists for the individual projects, e.g.  [Fluxnova-BPM-Platform Issues](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/issues) if you need inspiration. Be aware that some of the issues need good knowledge of the surrounding code.
1. [Create a fork of the project](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/fork) to contribute from. Create a feature branch in your fork to hold your changes.
1. Check your code changes against our [contribution checklist](#contribution-checklist)
    1. For large changes, open a draft PR before you have finished your implementation to get feedback.
1. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/pulls). 

## Browse our issues

We manage issues for the multiple Fluxnova projects through [our Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/116).
You can find the [full list of FINOS hosted Fluxnova projects here](https://github.com/finos/?q=fluxnova&type=all&language=&sort=).

## Build from source

### Building Fluxnova BPM Platform Locally

#### Important Note

Currently, not all Fluxnova packages on FINOS are public. To build `fluxnova-bpm-platform`, you must first clone and build
all dependent repositories locally. Once all packages are public, you will be able to build `fluxnova-bpm-platform` directly
without building dependencies locally.

#### Build Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Maven 3.8+
* Git

#### Build Order and Steps

1. **Clone and Build `fluxnova-release-parent` Repository**

   This repository contains the parent POM used by other Fluxnova projects.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-release-parent
   cd fluxnova-release-parent
   mvn clean install -o
   ```

2. **Clone and Build `fluxnova-bpm-release-parent` Repository**

   This repository is the next-level parent POM, used by downstream projects.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-release-parent
   cd fluxnova-bpm-release-parent
   mvn clean install -o
   ```

3. **Clone and Build `fluxnova-feel-scala` Repository**

   This repository is a dependency for `fluxnova-bpm-platform`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-feel-scala
   cd fluxnova-feel-scala
   # To skip tests (recommended for adopters only, contributors should always run tests):
   mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -o

   # To run all tests:
   mvn clean install -o
   ```

4. **Clone and Build `fluxnova-bpm-platform` Repository**

   Finally, build the main project. You can skip tests or run them as needed.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform
   cd fluxnova-bpm-platform
   # To skip tests:
   mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -o

   # To run all tests:
   mvn clean install -o
   ```

#### Notes

* The `-o` flag enables Maven offline mode, so it uses dependencies from your local `.m2/repository/org/fluxnova` directory.
* Artifacts from each build will be stored in your local Maven repository and used by subsequent builds.
* Once all Fluxnova dependencies are public, you can build `fluxnova-bpm-platform` directly without building the other repositories locally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Building with GitHub Actions on FINOS

The `fluxnova-bpm-platform` project uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD on FINOS. This workflow builds, tests, and deploys the project.

#### Workflow Triggers

* **Automatic Triggers:**  
  The workflow runs automatically on every push to the `main` branch and on every pull request.
* **Manual Trigger:**  
  You can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab using the "Run workflow" button.  
  When using this manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`), you can select which branch to build.

#### Steps in the Workflow

1. **Checkout Repository:**  
   Checks out the latest code from the selected branch.
2. **Java Setup:**  
   Sets up the required Java version.
3. **Git Configuration:**  
   Configures Git for the workflow environment.
4. **Set Project Version:**  
   Sets the Maven project version.
5. **Download Dependencies:**  
   Resolves and downloads all Maven dependencies and plugins.
6. **Build and Deploy:**  
   Builds the project and deploys artifacts to GitHub Packages.
7. **Run Tests:**  
   Runs unit and integration tests in separate jobs.

#### Deployment to GitHub Packages

The deployment of artifacts to GitHub Packages is configured in the root `pom.xml` using the `<distributionManagement>` and `<repositories>` tags.

* **`<distributionManagement>`**:  
  Specifies where Maven should deploy release and snapshot artifacts. For this project, both releases and snapshots are deployed to GitHub Packages.

* **`<repositories>`**:  
  Lists the Maven repositories (including GitHub Packages for all Fluxnova dependencies) from which dependencies are resolved during the build.

Example configuration in the root `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>fluxnova-bpm-platform</id>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>fluxnova-feel-scala</id>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-feel-scala</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>fluxnova-bpm-release-parent</id>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-release-parent</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>fluxnova-release-parent</id>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-release-parent</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<distributionManagement>
<repository>
   <id>fluxnova-bpm-platform</id>
   <name>GitHub Fluxnova Maven Packages</name>
   <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform</url>
</repository>
<snapshotRepository>
   <id>fluxnova-bpm-platform</id>
   <name>GitHub Fluxnova Maven Packages</name>
   <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform</url>
</snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```

An entire repository can then be built by running `mvn clean install` in the root directory.
This will build all sub modules and execute unit tests.
Furthermore, you can restrict the build to just the module you are changing by running the same command in the corresponding directory.
Check the repository's or module's README for additional module-specific instructions.
The `webapps` module requires NodeJS.
You can exclude building them by running `mvn clean install -pl '!webapps,!webapps/assembly,!webapps/assembly-jakarta'`.

#### Dependency Management

When building on GitHub Actions, you do **not** need to build dependent projects locally. All dependencies are already
built and published to GitHub Packages from their respective repositories. The workflow uses the `GH_TOKEN` (a GitHub Personal Access Token)
to access these packages securely.

#### Viewing Packages

* Go to the [Packages](https://github.com/orgs/finos/packages?tab=packages&q=org.fluxnova) section of the repository on GitHub to view published artifacts.
* These packages can be used as dependencies in other projects via GitHub Packages.


### Running Fluxnova BPM Platform

You can run Fluxnova in two modes: **Tomcat** and **Spring Boot**.

#### Running the Tomcat Version

1. After a successful build, extract the Tomcat distribution archive:
   ```bash
   unzip distro/tomcat/distro/target/fluxnova-bpm-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
   ```
2. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd fluxnova-bpm-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   ```
3. Start the Fluxnova Tomcat server:
   ```bash
   sh start-fluxnova.sh
   ```
4. Access the Fluxnova Monitoring at [http://localhost:8080/fluxnova/app/monitoring/default/#/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/fluxnova/app/monitoring/default/#/dashboard)

#### Running the Spring Boot Version

1. After a successful build, extract the Spring Boot distribution archive:
   ```bash
   unzip distro/run/distro/target/fluxnova-bpm-run-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
   ```
2. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd fluxnova-bpm-run-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   ```
3. Start the Spring Boot server:
   ```bash
   sh start.sh
   ```
4. Access the Fluxnova Monitoring at [http://localhost:8080/fluxnova/app/monitoring/default/#/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/fluxnova/app/monitoring/default/#/dashboard)

## Create a pull request

In order to show us your code, you can create a pull request on Github. Do this when your contribution is ready for review, or if you have started with your implementation and want some feedback before you continue. It is always easier to help if we can see your work in progress.

A pull request can be submitted as follows: 

1. [Fork the Fluxnova repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) you are contributing to
1. Commit and push your changes to a branch in your fork
1. [Submit a Pull Request to the Fluxnova repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). As the *base* branch (the one that you contribute to), select `main`. This should also be the default in the Github UI.

1. In the pull request description, reference the github issue that your pull request addresses.

## Contribution checklist

Before submitting your pull request for code review, please go through the following checklist:
** Wiki Pages are missing. Needs To Be Reviewed **
1. Is your code formatted according to our code style guidelines?
    * Java: Please check our [Java Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/Coding-Style-Java). You can also import [our template and settings files](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/tree/master/settings) into your IDE before you start coding.
    * Javascript: Your code is automatically formatted whenever you commit.
1. Is your code covered by unit tests?
    * Ask us if you are not sure where to write the tests or what kind of tests you should write.
    * Java: Please follow our [testing best practices](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/Testing-Best-Practices-Java).
    * Have a look at other tests in the same module for how it works.
    * In rare cases, it is not feasible to write an automated test. Please ask us if you think that is the case for your contribution.
1. Do your commits follow our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-conventions)?
1. Does your code use the [correct license headers](#license-headers)?

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must have a contributor license agreement (CLA) on file with FINOS before their pull requests will be merged. Please review the FINOS [contribution requirements](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution-compliance-requirements) and submit (or have your employer submit) the required CLA before submitting a pull request.

## Commit message conventions

The messages of all commits must conform to the style:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Example:

```
feat(engine): Support BPEL

- implements execution for a really old standard
- BPEL models are mapped to internal ActivityBehavior classes

related to #123
```

Have a look at the [commit history](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/commits/main) for real-life examples.

### \<type\>

One of the following:

* feat (feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, �)
* refactor
* test (when adding missing tests)
* chore (maintain)

### \<scope\>

The scope is the module that is changed by the commit. E.g. `engine` in the case of <https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/commits/main/engine>.

### \<subject\>

A brief summary of the change. Use imperative form (e.g. *implement* instead of *implemented*).  The entire subject line shall not exceed 70 characters.

### \<body\>

A list of bullet points giving a high-level overview of the contribution, e.g. which strategy was used for implementing the feature. Use present tense here (e.g. *implements* instead of *implemented*). A line in the body shall not exceed 80 characters. For small changes, the body can be omitted. 

### \<footer\>

Must be `related to <ticket>` where ticket is the ticket number, e.g. CAM-1234. If the change is related to multiple 
tickets, list them in a comma-separated list such as `related to CAM-1234, CAM-4321`.

Optionally, you can reference the number of the GitHub PR from which the commit is merged. The message footer can then 
look like `related to <ticket>, closes #<pr_number>` such as `related to CAM-1234, closes #567`.

## License headers [see issue](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/issues/141)

Every source file in an open-source repository needs to contain the following license header at  the top, formatted as a code comment: ** License. Needs To Be Reviewed **

```
Copyright Camunda Services GmbH and/or licensed to Camunda Services GmbH
under one or more contributor license agreements. See the NOTICE file
distributed with this work for additional information regarding copyright
ownership. Camunda licenses this file to you under the Apache License,
Version 2.0; you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
You may obtain a copy of the License at

    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

limitations under the License.
```

The header can be added manually (check other files). If you use our [IDE settings](https://github.com/finos/fluxnova-bpm-platform/tree/master/settings), it will be generated automatically when you create new `.java` files. You can also add it by running `mvn clean install -Plicense-header-check` in the module that you have changed. This command also re-formats any incorrectly formatted license header.

Contributions that do not contain valid license headers cannot be merged.

## Review process

We usually check for new community-submitted pull requests once a week. We will then assign a reviewer from our development team and that person will provide feedback as soon as possible. 

Note that due to other responsibilities (our own implementation tasks, releases), feedback can sometimes be a bit delayed. Especially for larger contributions, it can take a bit until we have the time to assess your code properly.

During review we will provide you with feedback and help to get your contribution merge-ready. However, before requesting a review, please go through our [contribution checklist](#contribution-checklist).

Once your code is merged, it will be shipped in the next alpha and minor releases. We usually build alpha releases once a month and minor releases once every six months. If you are curious about the exact next minor release date, check our [release announcements](https://docs.camunda.org/enterprise/announcement/) page. ** Needs To Be Reviewed **

## Governance

### Roles

The project community consists of Contributors and Maintainers:

* A **Contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.)
* A **Maintainer** is a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to project repositories and may merge approved contributions.
* The **Lead Maintainer** is the project's interface with the FINOS team and Board. They are responsible for approving [quarterly project reports](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#project-governing-board-reporting) and communicating on behalf of the project. The Lead Maintainer is elected by a vote of the Maintainers.

## Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
* All pull requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Pull requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer has an objection to the pull request, any Maintainer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer objects to a pull request, the Maintainers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

## Maintainer Voting

The Maintainers MAY hold votes only when they are unable to reach consensus on an issue. Any Maintainer MAY call a vote on a contested issue, after which Maintainers SHALL have 36 hours to register their votes. Votes SHALL take the form of "+1" (agree), "-1" (disagree), "+0" (abstain). Issues SHALL be decided by the majority of votes cast. If there is only one Maintainer, they SHALL decide any issue otherwise requiring a Maintainer vote. If a vote is tied, the Lead Maintainer MAY cast an additional tie-breaker vote.

The Maintainers SHALL decide the following matters by consensus or, if necessary, a vote:

* Contested pull requests
* Election and removal of the Lead Maintainer
* Election and removal of Maintainers

All Maintainer votes MUST be carried out transparently, with all discussion and voting occurring in public, either:

* in comments associated with the relevant issue or pull request, if applicable;
* on the project mailing list or other official public communication channel; or
* during a regular, minuted project meeting.

## Maintainer Qualifications

Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution to the project MAY apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. The existing Maintainers SHALL decide whether to approve the nomination according to the Maintainer Voting process above.

## Changes to this Document

This document MAY be amended by a vote of the Maintainers according to the Maintainer Voting process above.
